# Pokémon Infinity
Java project for unifying all of the world of Pokémon in 1 ultimate game experience. 

## Working title:
Infinity comes from the aspiration of making a game where there's tons of things to do.
Meaning you could have fun for an eternity.
Also, it states exactly how long it will take to finish this project...

##Basic Plan of Action:
  1. Make a game where you can run around in a world and interact with people and objects. No specific Pokémon-related stuff are necessary in this step. Also, make an application for creating and changing maps for this world. This makes our own job of creating the world easier and paves the way for future modding.
  2. Incorporate Pokémon-related game mechanics. For example: encounters of wild Pokémon and battles with trainers. But also, Pokédex, party Pokémon, PC stored Pokémon, bag of items, HM mechanics in world, and all the other sortlike stuff I'm forgetting right now.
  3. Scripting. In this last step, we'll try to fill the game with some kind of storyline. Because let's all be honest, as much fun catching all Pokémon and beating every trainer is, without a story there's something missing.

##Game content:
This game will incorporate all regions and Pokémon from all previous released Pokémon games. But the fun doesn't stop there. It should be our ambition to add stuff from the extended Pokémon universe (meaning the anime, manga,...), as long as it doesn't clash with the continuity of the games (which have priority of course).

##Legal disclaimer:
All Pokémon related material and ideas are owned by their respective owners. This project will and should always be free to use and distribute without any payment. This game will be made for fun by fans and should later be used for fun by fans.
